> Marionette.Module is deprecated, and is scheduled to be removed in the next major release of the library. Instead
of Marionette.Module, you should use AMD/CommonJS/ES6 for modularity. A Marionette.Module shim is available if necessary after its removal.

Marionette Modules allow you to create modular encapsulated logic.
They can be used to split apart large applications into multiple files, and to build individual components of your app.
